Introducing myself...nothing to say...

## Skills
None...

## Education
* october 2015 - present: Ph. D. student in Geophysics at MINES ParisTech - PSL Research University
* september 2014 - june 2015: Master 2 Research in Exploration Geophysics at Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris
* september 2011 - september 2014: Engineering degree in Earth Sciences at Polytech Paris-UPMC
* september 2009 - june 2011: CPGE in Physics and Chemistry (PC) at Lyc√©e Saint Louis

## Work experience
* february 2015 - june 2015 : R&D Geophysicist Intern at Total AS
    As part of the R&D team, my research Master thesis dealt with the feasibility
    of passive seismic tomography on onshore domain by designing and developing a
    workflow to retrieve the Green function from real ambient noise data and
    invert for a shear wave velocity model. This work includes:
    * Processing of ambient noise data: temporal normalization, spectral whitening,
      cross-correlation and stacking
    * Beamforming analysis to study the distribution of noise
    * Measuring of dispersion curves from cross-correlations using Frequency-Time analysis
    * Data quality control to reject bad measurements
    * Linear inversion for surface wave group velocity map at different periods
    * Non-linear inversion (Markov Chains Monte Carlo) for a shear wave velocity model
    All the codes have been implemented from scratch in Matlab.

* march 2014 - september 2014 : R&D Geophysicist Intern at CGG Services Norway AS
    As part of the Marine R&D team, my work focused on the vibration noise in 4C multicomponent
    towed streamer data. My main contributions were:
    * Understanding marine seismic acquisition using multicomponent sensors
    * Understanding why current noise attenuation method (f-k dip filetering, f-x deconvolution,
      Radon transform...) failed on such noise by reviewing the pros and cons of their
      applications on typical noise in marine seismic data (coherent and random)
    * Successfully implementing a new method to attenuate streamer vibration noise by developing
      an algorithm based on Singular Spectrum Analysis and defining a processing workflow
    I also part-time worked with the Subsurface Imaging team as a data processing geophysicist.
